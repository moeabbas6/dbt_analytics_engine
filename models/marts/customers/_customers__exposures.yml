      This dashboard provides a detailed view of customer segments based on the RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) framework. 
      It helps identify and classify customers into different segments, such as high-value customers, new customers, or inactive 
      customers, based on their purchasing behavior. The dashboard leverages data from the `dim_customers` table and is designed 
      to provide actionable insights for marketing and sales strategies.
