# dbt_analytics_engine 

The dbt_analytics_engine project is an end-to-end demonstration of my capabilities in analytics engineering using dbt (data build tool). This project replicates a complete data pipeline, from data extraction/generation, loading, and transformation, all the way to the end users' Business Intelligence (BI) tools, specifically Looker Studio.

Designed to showcase a comprehensive range of dbt features, the project includes data transformation, testing, and documentation. Additionally, I have created a dashboard in Looker Studio to visualize the output, demonstrating the full lifecycle of data from raw extraction/generation to actionable insights.
